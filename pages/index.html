  Open Angel Arena is a modern reimagining of the classic Angel Arena game mode.
  It was made by a group of passionate Angel Arena players who decided to bring
  their own vision to life. We revisited old features while modernizing and
  streamlining the gameplay, and built everything from scratch. It is a highly
  competitive game and there is a lot to learn.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Most heroes are viable</strong>, including supports, casters and tanks. In fact, supports are absolutely essential
      to many strategies.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>All items are upgradeable</strong>. This allows for a wide range of possible item builds and for an even wider range
      of possible strategies. Have you ever wanted to play attack damage Elder Titan using the 100% lifesteal talent or use
      Lunas ultimate to rain death and stuns on an entire team? In Open Angel Arena these strategies are not only possible
      but actually viable. </li>
    <li>
      <strong>New custom items</strong>, designed by the community and carefully balanced before being added.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bosses have been redesigned to be an integral part of the game and have been made more interesting</strong>. To upgrade
      items you have to kill bosses, often as early as 10 minutes into the game and then regularly for the rest of the match.
      A killed boss respawns as a new, stronger boss with new abilities. Bosses in OAA have various mechanics that you will
      have to deal with while battling them and aren’t simple DPS tanks.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Duels have been redesigned to include objectives that encourage players to fight and enable objective based gameplay</strong>.
      There are multiple different duel arenas that you can be placed into and you will always be playing in a duel. If there
      is a 1v1 in one arena there is also a 4v4 in a different one and so on.</li>
    <li>To win the game you must win a Final Duel.
      <strong>The first team to 100 points will trigger a Final Duel. The team with 100 points then needs to win this Final Duel
        to win the game</strong>. If they don’t then the games score limit gets extended by 10, putting it into overtime.
      This goes on until a team wins a Final Duel.</li>
    <li>Fountain camping has been eliminated from the game.</li>
